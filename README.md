# sc-community-content-web
A web based community content browser for the game Survivalcraft. Work in progress.

## Try it out at https://thenoswad.github.io/sc-community-content-web/

A CORS error is produced when requesting data from the community content server so a workaround is required. I'm using the CORS Anywhere proxy temporarily until I can decide on a proper solution.

To enable the proxy for testing or development go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and request access.
